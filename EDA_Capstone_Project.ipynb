        "1. Segment Guests by Cancellation Risk\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Use lead time, special requests, and past cancellations to flag high-risk bookings.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "      * Direct and corporate bookings showed stable ADR and lower cancellation rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Focus marketing on these segments to improve profit margins and reduce OTA dependency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Prioritize Room Type Accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Room mismatches increase cancellation - ensure accurate allocations.\n",
        "      * Also ensure room allocation systems are synced and transparent to improve trust.\n",

        "      * Transient customers and Online TA segments contribute most cancellations.\n",
